    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>Chicken Breasts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 boneless skinless Chicken Breasts</li>
      <li>Salt to Taste</li>
      <li>Pepper to Taste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. Paprika</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tsp. Olive Oil</li>
      <li>3 cups Chopped Spinach</li>
      <li>4 Minced Garlic Cloves</li>
      <li>1/3 cup Drained/Chopped Dried Tomatoes</li>
      <li>4 oz. Softened Cream Cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup Shredded Mozarella</li>
      <li>1/3 cup Grated Parmesan</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. Dried Basil</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. Dried Oregano</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. Onion Powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch Red Pepper Flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375° F.</li>
      <li>
        Add 1-2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
        spinach and garlic and cook until wilted, 3-4 minutes. Let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the spinach/garlic and sundried tomatoes aside. Combine remaining
        filling ingredients, then gently stir in the spinach/garlic and
        tomatoes. Set aside.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Chicken:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pat the chicken dry. Use a sharp paring knife to create a pocket for the
        stuffing. (Slice the side of the chicken that has the fold on the
        bottom.) Be careful not to cut all the way through to the other side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stuff each chicken breast with the filling. Sprinkle the top of the
        chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is
        glistening and hot, add 2 chicken breasts at a time and sear each side
        until it begins to turn golden, 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your skillet is not oven safe, transfer the chicken to a baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake at 375° for 17-20 minutes, or until the thickest part of the
        chicken reaches 165°. Rest for 5 minutes prior to serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
