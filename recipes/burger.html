    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This burger is a two-hander, topped with Japanese-spiced Chili, Tomatoes,
      and Shredded Iceberg lettuce. Be careful not to overmix the beef before
      shaping it into patties; a light hand yields tender burgers.
    </p>

      <li>1 1/2 tsp. Ground Cumin</li>

      <li>1 1/2 tsp. Divided Ground Black Pepper</li>
      <li>8 Buttered and Toasted Sesame Seed Hamburger Buns</li>
      <li>8 Tomato Slices</li>
      <li>2 cups Shredded Iceberg Lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir together Kewpie mayonnaise, ketchup, and yuzu juice in a bowl.
        Refrigerate until ready to serve. Process canned tomatoes in a food
        processor until smooth, about 1 minute. Set processed tomatoes aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add 1 pound ground beef,
        onion, and 2 teaspoons salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is
        no longer pink and onion is lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Add
        processed tomatoes, tonkatsu, gochugaru, sugar, coriander, and cumin;
        stir in sake. Bring to a simmer. Stir together 1/4 cup cold water and
        flour in small bowl; add to ground beef mixture, and stir to combine.
        Stir in smoked paprika and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Reduce heat to
        medium-low, and return to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, 10 minutes.
        Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat grill or griddle to medium (350°F to 450°F). Gently stir
        together remaining 3 pounds ground beef, remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and
        remaining 1 teaspoon black pepper in a large bowl until just combined.
        Shape mixture into 8 (6-ounce) patties, pressing to 1/2-inch thickness.
        Place on oiled grates, and grill, covered, to desired degree of
        doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place patties on buns. Top each with 1/3 cup chili, 1 tomato slice, 1/4
        cup lettuce, and 1 tablespoon mayonnaise mixture.
      </li>
    </ol>
