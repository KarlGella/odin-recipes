      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine beef, egg, bread crumbs, garlic powder, onion
        powder, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Divide beef mixture
        into 4 patties, then flatten to ½” thick oval patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add patties and cook
        until golden and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Remove from
        skillet and set aside to keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        To same pan, melt butter. Add mushrooms and onions and cook until
        softened, 5 minutes. Add flour and toss to coat veggies. Slowly whisk in
        broth, then add worcestershire and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce
        heat to a simmer and let simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season
        with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return steaks to skillet and spoon sauce over. Heat until warmed
        through.
